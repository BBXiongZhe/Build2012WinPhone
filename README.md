Microsoft TechEd Australia - Windows Phone 7 app
=============

A companion application for attendees of Microsoft TechEd Australia in 2012.  It is based on the "Starter kit for conferences"  [http://smallandmighty.net/blog/windows-phone-starter-kit-for-conferences](http://smallandmighty.net/blog/windows-phone-starter-kit-for-conferences)

The application was simplified greatly by replacing the custom logic for grouping and sorting, and instead replacing it with the [NetAdvantage controls for Windows Phone](http://www.infragistics.com/products/windows-phone) which support this functionality directly. This also sped up the loading and scrolling of the list dramatically.
I also added functionality to cache the OData results for 2 hours.
